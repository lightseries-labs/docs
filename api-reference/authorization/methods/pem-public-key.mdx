### When to use

Wanna allow your end users to read/write data directly to Lightseries? You're in the right place.

### How it works

This is done by using a public key to verify the JWT token. The key is a PEM encoded RSA public key. You can save this public key into our dashboard and the api will use it to confirm that the user that is making the request is indeed using a token that was signed using your private key.

```http
x-authorization: <your_jwt_token>
x-authorization-key-id: <your_public_key_id>
```
