There are currently two methods of authentication, both of which are based on the use of HTTP headers and serve different usecases.

- **API Key**: simply copy the API key from the dashboard and use it as a header in your requests.
- **PEM Public Key**: add your public key to the dashboard and send a signed JWT token as a header in your requests.

We also provide a simple way of configuring more granular access control for both of these methods via the use of permissions.
